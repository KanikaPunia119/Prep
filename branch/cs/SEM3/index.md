## Labs
<a name="labs"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand Labs</strong> — SEM3 lab folders</summary>

The SEM3 lab folders (from your attachment):

- 📁 CS203: Data Structure Laboratory
- 📁 EC222: Electronic Circuits & Switching Laboratory
- 📁 EE223: Microprocessor and Microcontroller Laboratory

**Notes**

- If these folders don't exist yet in the repo, I can create them and add a placeholder `README.md` in each.
- To link lab manuals or experiment PDFs here, place files under `branch/cs/SEM3/labs/<LabFolder>/` (or inside `branch/cs/SEM3/<LabFolder>/`) and I'll add direct links.

## PYQs (Previous Year Questions)
<a name="pyqs-previous-year-questions"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand PYQs</strong> — organized Midsem & Endsem</summary>

Organize PYQs by subject under `PYQs/<Subject>/` with filenames like `Subject_Mid_YYYY.pdf` or `Subject_End_YYYY.pdf`.

<details>
<summary><em>Midsem</em></summary>

- Example: `PYQs/CS201/CS201_Mid_2024.pdf`
- Example: `PYQs/MA201/MA201_Mid_2023.pdf`

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Endsem</em></summary>

- Example: `PYQs/CS201/CS201_End_2024.pdf`
- Example: `PYQs/EC221/EC221_End_2023.pdf`

</details>

**Add links** — when you add PDFs to the repository I can insert direct links here.

## Resources & Checklist

- [ ] Add real PYQ PDFs under `PYQs/` (one folder per subject)
- [ ] Add lab manuals / sample code under `branch/cs/SEM3/` (e.g., `labs/`, `code/`)
- [ ] Add short README files inside each subject folder explaining naming conventions

---

## How to contribute

- To add a PYQ: create `PYQs/<Subject>/` and name files like `Subject_Mid_YYYY.pdf`.
- To link a PDF here, paste a relative link (e.g., `[CS201 Mid 2024](./PYQs/CS201/CS201_Mid_2024.pdf)`).
- If you want me to create the lab folders and placeholders now, say "create lab folders" and I'll add them.

*Want a different style (visual cards, subject pages with images, or autogenerated index pages)? Tell me which and I’ll implement it.*
