How to use

- For each link: either download the PDF and commit it into the appropriate subject folder, or paste the share link into that subject folder's README under `LINKS:`.
- If you'd like, tell me how you want these mapped to subjects (e.g., "links 1-3 → CS101, 4-5 → MA101, ...") and I will update the README files and add direct links on the SEM1 page.

Next steps I can do for you

- Create actual PDF placeholders here (I won't download from Drive automatically).
- Map these links into the subject READMEs if you tell me which link goes to which subject.
- Auto-add the Drive links to the SEM1 index page under the PYQs section if you confirm mapping.
