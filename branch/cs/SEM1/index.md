## Subjects
<a name="subjects"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand Subjects</strong> — core SEM1 list</summary>

Here are the SEM1 subjects (click a subject to open its folder README):

- 🔗 [📁 CE102: Environmental Science & Engineering](./CE102/README.md)
- 🔗 [📁 CH101: Chemistry](./CH101/README.md)
- 🔗 [📁 CS101: Introduction to Programming](./CS101/README.md)
- 🔗 [📁 EC101: Basic Electronics](./EC101/README.md)
- 🔗 [📁 MA101: Mathematics I](./MA101/README.md)

**Quick tips**

- The links above open the subject `README.md` in each folder. From there you can add files or Drive links and keep an index.
- If you prefer the links point to a different file (for example `index.md` inside each folder), tell me and I will adjust the target paths.

## Labs
<a name="labs"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand Labs</strong> — typical practicals & quick lab links</summary>

**SEM1 lab sessions**

- 🔗 📁 [CH111: Chemistry Lab](./CH101/README.md)
- 🔗 📁 [CS111: Introduction to Programming Lab](./CS111/README.md)
- 🔗 📁 [EC111: Basic Electronics Lab](./EC101/README.md)

**Lab resource ideas**

- Keep lab manuals as PDFs in `branch/cs/SEM1/labs/` or `branch/cs/SEM1/LabNotes/`.
- Add sample datasets or input files used in lab exercises.

## PYQs (Previous Year Questions)

> NOTE: The PYQs section has been moved to each subject's README so every subject can maintain its own Midsem / Endsem / Minors files. Use the subject links in the "Subjects" section above to open a subject and add PYQs there (each subject README now contains a PYQs collapsible area).

If you need a central index for PYQs later, I can add one that aggregates per-subject entries automatically.

## Resources & Checklist

- [ ] Add real PYQ PDFs under `PYQs/` (one folder per subject)
- [ ] Add lab manuals / sample code under `branch/cs/SEM1/` (e.g., `labs/`, `code/`)
- [ ] Add short README files inside each subject folder explaining naming conventions

---

## How to contribute

- To add a PYQ: create `PYQs/<Subject>/` and name files like `Subject_Mid_YYYY.pdf`.
- To link a PDF here, paste a relative link (e.g., `[Programming Mid 2024](./PYQs/Programming/Programming_Mid_2024.pdf)`).
- If you want, say "scan and populate" and I'll search the repo for PDFs and insert direct links.

*If you'd like a different look (cards, images, or a small index page per subject) I can add that — tell me which style you prefer.*
