## Subjects
<a name="subjects"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand Subjects</strong> — SEM2 subjects</summary>

Here are the SEM2 subjects (click a subject to open its folder README):

- � [�📁 EE101: Basic Electrical Engineering](./EE101/README.md)
- � [�📁 HS101: Communicative English](./HS101/README.md)
- 🔗 [📁 MA102: Mathematics II](./MA102/README.md)
- 🔗 [📁 ME101: Engineering Mechanics](./ME101/README.md)
- 🔗 [📁 PH101: Physics](./PH101/README.md)

**Quick tips**

- Add lecture notes and solved examples inside `branch/cs/SEM2/<Subject>/`.
- Keep PYQs under `PYQs/<Subject>/` for consistent linking.

</details>

## Labs
<a name="labs"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand Labs</strong> — lab folders for SEM2</summary>

The SEM2 labs (as shown in your attachment):

- 📁 CE101: Engineering Graphics & Design
- 📁 EE121: Basic Electrical Engineering Laboratory
- 📁 PH111: Physics Laboratory

**Notes**

- If these folders don't exist yet in the repo, I can create them and add a placeholder README in each (recommended).
- To link lab manuals or experiment PDFs here, place files under `branch/cs/SEM2/labs/<LabFolder>/` and I'll add direct links.

## PYQs (Previous Year Questions)
<a name="pyqs-previous-year-questions"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand PYQs</strong> — organized Midsem & Endsem</summary>

Organize PYQs by subject under `PYQs/<Subject>/` with filenames like `Subject_Mid_YYYY.pdf` or `Subject_End_YYYY.pdf`.

<details>
<summary><em>Midsem</em></summary>

- Example: `PYQs/EE101/EE101_Mid_2024.pdf`
- Example: `PYQs/MA102/MA102_Mid_2023.pdf`

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Endsem</em></summary>

- Example: `PYQs/EE101/EE101_End_2024.pdf`
- Example: `PYQs/PH101/PH101_End_2023.pdf`

</details>

**Add links** — when you add PDFs to the repository I can insert direct links here.

## Resources & Checklist

- [ ] Add real PYQ PDFs under `PYQs/` (one folder per subject)
- [ ] Add lab manuals / sample code under `branch/cs/SEM2/` (e.g., `labs/`, `code/`)
- [ ] Add short README files inside each subject folder explaining naming conventions

---

## How to contribute

- To add a PYQ: create `PYQs/<Subject>/` and name files like `Subject_Mid_YYYY.pdf`.
- To link a PDF here, paste a relative link (e.g., `[EE101 Mid 2024](./PYQs/EE101/EE101_Mid_2024.pdf)`).
- If you want me to create the lab folders and placeholders now, say "create lab folders" and I'll add them.

*Want a different style (visual cards, subject pages with images, or autogenerated index pages)? Tell me which and I’ll implement it.*
